# Quality Profiles

Profiles you can copy and paste to use for your desired profiles. You can always modify and create own profiles just copy the existing configs as base and modify as wanted.

For example you like the base for the german custom formats:

- you can either just adjust scorings for specific custom formats
- or you can copy everything as base and maintain the scores without the need of a forked templates repo

:::tip
If you are starting to setup probably start taking a look at [HowTos](../examples)
:::

## Existing base templates

You can use existing base templates from:

- Recyclarr:

  - [Radarr](https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates/tree/master/radarr)
  - [Sonarr](https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates/tree/master/sonarr)

    :::note
    Recyclarr `includes` will be updated automatically because they are included. Recyclarr `Templates` themselve _NOT_ and you have to update them if they will be changed in repository.
    :::

- TRaSH-Guides:
  - [Radarr](https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides/tree/master/docs/json/radarr/quality-profiles)
  - [Sonarr](https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides/tree/master/docs/json/sonarr/quality-profiles)

## German profiles

We can use the existing templates provided in the TRaSH-Guides (recommended) or Recyclarr to start with a good starting base.
Afterwards you can adjust scores as you need them to be or adopt the profile and customize it completely to your requirements.
If you need to know how to include those templates [see here](../examples).

## Modifications / Adjustments

Please check the [Config](../configuration/config-file) for all available options.

- Adjusting the `language` of a QualityProfile.
  TRaSH-Guide profiles has added support for the `language` in their provided JSON files.
  This will be used if available.
  But you can also adjust the value also in the config file.

  ```yaml title="config.yml"
  radarr:
    instance1:
      # ...

      quality_profiles:
        - name: HD Bluray + WEB
          # Support added with 1.7.0. Not support in all *arr applications. Check the application if it is supported.
          language: Any # The name must match available names in *arr
  ```

- Adjusting scoring for custom formats:

  ```yaml title="config.yml"
  radarr:
    instance1:
      # ...

    custom_formats: # Custom format assignments
      - trash_ids:
          - 9f6cbff8cfe4ebbc1bde14c7b7bec0de # Some existing CustomFormat (this is the ID from TRaSH-Guides)
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD Bluray + WEB # The existing or new QualityProfile Name. Must match!
            score: 0 # New scoring
  ```
