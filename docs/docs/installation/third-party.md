Setting up in Unraid with docker is straigth forward and combined with `ofelia` we can schedule the containers easily.

_HINT_: The provided Apps in Unraid are not maintained by us!

Make sure to enable Advanced/extended view in Unraid (top right).

- Configarr:

  ```
  Name: configarr (we need this later on)
  Repository: configarr/configarr:latest # Recommendation: use tags like 1.9.0

  (add volume mappings like your setups requires it. Example with <name> - <host/unraid path>:<container path>)
  Config volume - /mnt/user/appdata/configarr/config:/app/config
  Repo cache - /mnt/user/appdata/configarr/repos:/app/repos
  Custom formats - /mnt/user/appdata/configarr/cfs:/app/cfs
  Templates - /mnt/user/appdata/configarr/templates:/app/templates
  ```

  - Add other variables or mapping as your setup requires it
  - Afterwards create the required files in the config volume `config.yml` and `secrets.yml` (check examples or this guide)

- Ofelia (scheduler):

  ```
  Name: ofelia
  Repository: mcuadros/ofelia:latest # Recommendation: use specific tags not latest
  Post Arguments: daemon --config=/opt/config.ini

  (add volume mappings like your setups requires it. Example with <name> - <host/unraid path>:<container path>)
  Docker socket - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock (Read Only)
  Ofelia config file - /mnt/user/appdata/ofelia/ofelia.ini:/opt/config.ini (Read only)
  ```

  - Make sure to create the `ofelia.ini` file best before starting the container

  ```ini
  [job-run "run-configarr-existing-container"]
  schedule = @every 10s # adjust as required. Recommendation every 3h or so
  container = configarr # this is the name of container we gave
  ```

  - you can also activate `autostart` for ofelia

![Unraid Setup with the containers](_images/unraid_setup.webp)

Now start both containers.
Check the logs if configarr works as expected (exit code should be 0).
Ofelia should keep running and restarting the configarr in your defined interval.

**Enjoy!**

- For scheduled runs you can use [scheduled tasks](https://kb.synology.com/en-au/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/system_taskscheduler?version=7) in order to run configarr in a cron way.
