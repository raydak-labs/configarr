# Configarr

Configuration and synchronization tool for Sonarr and Radarr.

This will be a project similar to [Recyclarr](https://github.com/recyclarr/recyclarr) or [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.wiki/) but support for additional specification and not only what [TrashGuides](https://trash-guides.info/) offer.

This is in very early development and trial stage to see if this is something we want to offer or not.

> :warning: **This is in very early development and trial stage to see if this is something we want to offer or not.**

Possible ideas:

- keep support for syncing trash guides
  - I like the possible configuration in recyclarr but I miss some features
- add support for local configuration to include
  - I don't want to fork a project to add custom things to it
- Maybe an free GUI to sync your stuff
- Add additional best configuration for different languages/countries like Germany

## Work TODOs

- [ ] Optimize types. Generated ones work for first step but not very optimal because they do not correctly represent request/response types.
- [x] Default scores from trash guide
- [ ] Radarr support
